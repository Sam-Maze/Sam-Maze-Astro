# Sam-Maze.com

Welcome to the codebase for my personal website, [Sam-Maze.com](https://sam-maze.com).
There isn't anything too interesting to see here. I'm dipping my toes back into the waters of 
coding in a non-corporate setting, and this website is meant to serve as the cornerstone for that journey.

I'm unfortunately not yet a pro-designer, so I've borrowed the theme for this site from [Manuel Ernesto](https://astrofy-template.netlify.app), huge kudos to him for creating such a clean template!
