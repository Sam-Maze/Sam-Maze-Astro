My plan for this blog is to post one-off life updates, some more technical posts about the projects I'm 
currently working on, and general musings about the state of technology. With that said, I think the
best way to kick off this first post is to give you a bit more background on myself. I'll try not to repeat
any information that can already be found elsewhere on this site.

I grew up in the suburbs of a small city in central Virginia. My family and I actually lived far enough away 
from the city that we could nearly make out the Milky Way from our back yard. A favorite pastime of mine growing
up was stargazing and seeing which constellations I could make out. Like many 90's kids, another pastime of mine 
was finding pretty much anything I could do with technology. I grew up playing games like Putt-Putt, Freddie Fish, 
and Pajama Sam from a young age, but I feel lucky in that I also spent a great deal of time outdoors. My parents took me and my siblings camping and hiking, and I've always had a certain reverence for nature.

Those three themes: space, technology, and nature have always played a crucial role in my life. I think of them as the sort of building-blocks of my intellectual pursuits. I plan on using those three pillars as a guide when exploring which future projects I'm interested in pursuing.
